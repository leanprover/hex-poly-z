Kernel microbenchmark for the integer dense polynomial product: schoolbook
convolution against Kronecker substitution, by degree and coefficient width.

This is the measurement behind `Hex.ZPoly.kroneckerSizeCutoff` and
`Hex.ZPoly.kroneckerBitCutoff` (see `HexPolyZ/SPEC/hex-poly-z.md`). It is a
manual diagnostic driver, not a CI job and not a `lean-bench` registration: it
sweeps a two-dimensional grid looking for a crossover rather than fitting one
operation against a declared complexity model, so it does not belong in the
scientific harness.

Both arms run through `Hex.ZPoly.mulKroneckerAt`, with the cutoffs set to force
one path or the other, so the two arms differ only in the kernel. Emits one
JSON document on stdout; `scripts/bench/kronecker_crossover.py` pins it to a
verified-idle core and wraps the result with environment metadata.

/-- Time `reps` products at fixed cutoffs.

Each iteration selects its left operand by a branch on the running checksum, so
the product depends on the previous iteration and cannot be hoisted out of the
loop — without this the compiler lifts the whole loop body and the measured
times are a flat few nanoseconds at every degree.

The checksum is seeded from the clock and only ever advanced by an even amount,
so the branch is not statically decidable but always takes the same side at
runtime: every iteration multiplies the same pair, and the two arms compare
like for like. Seeding it from a literal would let a sufficiently strong
optimiser prove the branch constant and hoist the loop body again. The caller
passes one seed to both arms so their checksums remain comparable. -/
